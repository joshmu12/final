# ICS4U - FPL Tracker

This repository is a capstone for my final project in ICS4U. My final project is a tracker for the popular online game Fantasy Premier League, displaying Premier League player stats, as well as user details. This is acheived by using Streamlit, Python, Pandas and Plotly. I also incorporated API into my project for the data needed. 


# Goals:

- Display stats related to FPL for every player in the Premier League
- Display player and team images
- Display player stats through graphs, incorporating past gamewweeks data 
- Display teams fixtures, and update accordingly
- Rank players by different stats
- Display user stats, by entering their code
- Team builder
- Show the best players to buy for each team
